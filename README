What is it?
-----------
Camelapse is a Perl program that can take a series of still images (typically 
recorded by a Webcam) and turn them into a daily time lapse movie file.  Many 
Webcams, IP cameras, and security cameras have a feature for recording still 
images when motion is detected, but few include software to automatically 
provide a quick and easy daily review of those stills in the form of a time 
lapse movie.  This script was created to provide that.  You are welcome to use 
and modify the code to suit your local needs under the terms of the MIT 
license.  Please share any suggestions or improvements with the author so they 
can be integrated and shared with everyone.
