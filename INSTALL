Camelapse Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------

This initial release is intended for people who are running their own private 
server and have access to the still images already uploaded to it by their 
camera, and who are reasonably familiar with a Unix command line, and 
configuring & running scripts as a cron job.  Configuration and use of your 
camera is outside the scope of this doc.  Please contact your manufacturer's 
documentation for help with that.

Install required libraries & packages
-------------------------------------

The main script ("make_movies.pl") expects the following:
* Date::Manip (install using Perl's cpan installer)
* File::Basename  (install using Perl's cpan installer)
* ffmpeg (install using your usual package manager you prefer)

Install main files & folders
----------------------------

* Move the camelapse folder to your home directory
* Create target folders in your public_html (htdocs) folder
  * /camelapse/snap (your camera's still images should go here)
  * /videos (script-generated movies will go here)

Set configuration values
------------------------

* Look for the "customizable values" section of make_movies.pl
* Change any items in {brackets} to your preferred settings
* Set your camera to record snapshots to filenames as follows:

Format:  {filename_prefix}{YYYYmmdd}-{HHmmss}
Example: MyWebcamSnap_20150307-090931.jpg

The most important parts are the prefix (typically a name you specify in your 
camera's software to begin every still image recorded), the date in "YYYYmmdd" 
format, and the time in "Hhmmss" format.  If you are not sure what these values 
mean or how to set them in your camera's software, please ask the Internet.  :-)

These filename patterns are important as the script (as of the current release) 
is looking for filenames based on date so that they can be properly consumed, 
turned into movies, then rotated out to keep your folders tidy & clean.

Be sure you make any necessary changes in make_movies.pl, too, so that they 
reflect your settings in your camera's filename preferences.

If you are not sure about any of the specifics, it may be useful to put a few 
test images into your "{public_path}/camelapse/snap" folder and run the script 
to make sure everything is processed the way you want.

Set permissions & security
--------------------------

* Set appropriate write permissions to the various folders so that the script 
can create and move files as needed.
* Strongly advised that you set htaccess passwords on the public folders 
(Web-accessible "{public_path}/camelapse/snap" and "{public_path}/videos") so 
the general public won't stumble onto your private snapshots and movies.  :-)

Run a test
----------

* Run the script to make sure everything works
  * Drop a few still images into your "{public_path}/camelapse/snap" folder
  * Test filename values for YYYYmmdd should be *yesterday's* date
  * From the camelapse folder, run:  perl make_movies.pl
* Movie is generated under /videos -- if not, double check permissions & paths
* To re-test, you must re-add your test images to {public_path}/camelapse/snap

Set up a daily cron job to run the script
-----------------------------------------

Now that you've successfully generated a movie, and have set up your camera to 
regularly upload still images in the proper filename format to 
{public_path}/camelapse/snap, you should set up a cron job to run the script 
daily so you can routinely visit your {public_path}/videos folder for daily 
updated movies (replace "{username}" as needed):

# run daily movie maker for yesterday's webcam still images
0 1 * * * /usr/bin/perl /home/{username}/camelapse/make_movies.pl 2>&1

Go for a walk or a run
----------------------

Good!  You're finished.  Now you can come back anytime to visit your 
http://{your_domain}/videos/ folder (you remembered to password-protect it 
along with http://{your_domain}/camelapse/snap/, right?) and see the latest 
daily videos.

Since you've been sitting in your chair a while, time to go out for a walk or a 
run.  Exercise & stay healthy!  :)
