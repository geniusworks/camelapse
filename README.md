### Overview

Camelapse is a Perl program that can take a series of still images (typically
recorded by a Webcam) and turn them into a daily time lapse movie file.  Many
Webcams, IP cameras, and security cameras have a feature for recording still
images when motion is detected, but few include software to automatically
provide a quick and easy daily review of those stills in the form of a time
lapse movie.  This script was created to provide that.

Note: This program was created some time ago and deployed
to convert images captured by the University of Southern California's
"TommyCam" into time lapse movies.
